# My-Application
This is my first application that I make for decreasing the work load.

For run this app you have to install tesseract from .exe in this git and store the tessract.exe in PATH "C:\Program Files (x86)\tesseract.exe"

# from python to exe file use "**auto-py-to-exe**" and add the customtkinter lib in this file before you convert to exe file.
